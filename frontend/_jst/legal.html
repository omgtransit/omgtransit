  <p><b>omgtransit.com</b>'s goal is to provide you awesome, real-time information regarding your transit options. But there are a few things you should know.</p>

  <p>Essentially all of the data we provide comes to us from other agencies. We're pretty sure these guys are doing their best to get you accurate information. But consider that there are over <b>13,000</b> bus stops in Minneapolis alone. Sometimes mistakes are made, and there's not too much we at omgtransit.com can do about it other than forward problems on as we become aware of them. <b>We're not responsible for these kinds of mistakes.</b></p>

  <p>Similarly, our real-time information comes from satellite's orbiting the Earth at hundreds of miles per hour, gets beamed through an unpredictable atmosphere to buses, trains, and planes, gets beamed by these vehicles to cell towers, goes through cables to the transit provider's computers, and then comes to us… and then to you. There are a lot of places in that chain where something can go wrong. We do our best to get you the information you want, but we <b>aren't responsible</b> for and <b>can't fix</b> upstream problems (though we do our best to communicate with those who can).</p>

  <p>Also, our servers are physical objects run by real people. Sometimes, they too break down. When this happens our back-up servers are trained to come online. But sometimes mistakes can happen here. We'll do our best to prevent this from happening, but, if it does, we're <b>not responsible</b>.</p>

  <p>At this point, you may be wondering what we are responsible for. Honestly, in the legal sense, not much. But, as mentioned above, <b>we will do our best</b>. Beyond that… </p>
